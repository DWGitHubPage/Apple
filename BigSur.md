## Just updated to Big Sur from Catalina and will put things that I come across with it here for future reference.

- ## Show the Percentage of Battery at the top of Desktop:
1. Click on the top left **Apple logo** and go to **System Preferences**.
2. Then go to **Dock & Menu Bar**.
3. On the left-side column go down to **Other Modules** and click on **Battery Menu Bar** which should be the second one down.
4. Checkmark **Show Percentage**.
